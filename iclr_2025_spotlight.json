      "Large language models learn and continually learn through the accumulationof gradient-based updates, but how individual pieces of new information affectexisting knowledge, leading to both beneficial generalization and problematic hal-lucination, remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that when learning newinformation, LLMs exhibit a \"priming\" effect: learning a new fact can cause themodel to inappropriately apply that knowledge in unrelated contexts. To systemati-cally study this phenomenon, we introduce \"Outlandish,\" a carefully curated datasetof 1320 diverse text samples designed to probe how new knowledge permeatesthrough an LLM’s existing knowledge base. Using this dataset, we show that thedegree of priming after learning new information can be predicted by measuringthe token probability of key words before learning. This relationship holds robustlyacross different model architectures (PALM-2, Gemma, Llama), sizes, and trainingstages. Finally, we develop two novel techniques to modulate how new knowledgeaffects existing model behavior: (1) a “stepping-stone” text augmentation strategyand (2) an “ignore-k” update pruning method. These approaches reduce undesir-able priming effects by 50-95% while preserving the model’s ability to learn newinformation. Our findings provide both empirical insights into how LLMs learnand practical tools for improving the specificity of knowledge insertion in languagemodels.
